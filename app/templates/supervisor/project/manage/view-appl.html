<b>IDEAS</b>:
<br>
If we do my way:
Student Name | Examine | Accept | Deny
<br>
<br>
better way:
<br>
Myadmin kind of table
<br>
Somehow integrate from Mang's stuff, or redirect ??
<br>
Add Accept and Deny actions
<br>
Store accept/deny in student database?
<br>
   - proj1_accepted = T or F
<br>
   - proj2_accepted = T or F
<br>
Only let supervisor add students equal to limit
